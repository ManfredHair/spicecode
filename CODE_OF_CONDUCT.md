# The Spice Code of Conduct  

## **The Great Pledge**  

As Fremen of this digital desert, we pledge to make our oasis of code a safe and welcoming place for all. Regardless of background, experience, or identity, all who walk the sands of Spice Code CLI shall find respect and camaraderie.  

We shall act with honor, uphold fairness, and protect our community from the corruption of toxicity, so that our shared journey may be one of learning and mutual growth.  

## **The Way of the Spice**  

To ensure our collective strength, we adhere to these principles:  

### **What is Expected of All Fremen**  

- Show kindness, patience, and respect to fellow travelers.  
- Honor differences in coding styles, ideas, and perspectives.  
- Provide constructive feedback with humility and receive it with grace.  
- Accept responsibility for mistakes and strive to improve.  
- Work for the greater good of the community, not just personal gain.  

### **That Which is Forbidden**  

- Harassment, discrimination, or hostility in any form.  
- Trolling, insults, or personal attacks—only the weak resort to such things.  
- Sharing private information without consent, for such betrayals are not easily forgiven.  
- Any conduct unbecoming of a Fremen coder that disrupts the harmony of our sietch.  

## **The Law of the Desert**  

The stewards of Spice Code CLI (maintainers and community leaders) shall act as judges in matters of discord. They have the right to remove, edit, or reject any contribution that violates our principles.  

## **The Fremen Enforcement Measures**  

Those who stray from the path shall be met with fair but firm consequences:  

### **1. A Whisper on the Wind**  

_Impact_: A minor breach—unintended offense or misunderstanding.  
_Consequence_: A private warning and guidance toward the proper path.  

### **2. The Warning of the Sietch**  

_Impact_: A more serious offense or repeated minor offenses.  
_Consequence_: A public warning with temporary restrictions on participation.  

### **3. Exile from the Oasis**  

_Impact_: Disruptive or harmful behavior that endangers the community.  
_Consequence_: A temporary ban from Spice Code CLI spaces.  

### **4. Cast Into the Deep Desert**  

_Impact_: Malicious intent, harassment, or repeated major offenses.  
_Consequence_: Permanent banishment—no spice, no code, no return.  

## **Reporting a Violation**  

If you witness behavior unworthy of the Spice Code, report it to the stewards at spicecodecli@gmail.com. Reports will be handled swiftly, fairly, and with the utmost discretion.  

## **Final Words**  

Spice Code CLI exists to empower developers. Let us build with respect, learn from one another, and ensure our community thrives. The spice must flow, but toxicity shall not.  

**“He who controls the code, controls the future.”**
